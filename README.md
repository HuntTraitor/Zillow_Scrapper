A script that scraps all of the houses in Seatlle, WA listed on Zillow and stores them in a database

ISSUES:
- Need to add a cache system where I don't parese through the entire database everytime the graph is updated
- Need to figure out how to automatically run the script every day on a server
- Need to update prices on address when corresponding price is updated on website

NOTES:
- Currently doing ongoing testing to see whether or not the database is getting signifigantly longer to parse each run (testing indexing)
