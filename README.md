A script that scraps all of the houses in Seatlle, WA listed on Zillow and stores them in a database

ISSUES:
- Need to figure out how to automatically run the script every day on a server

FUTURE:
- Add a dropdown to select the zipcode for graph
- Style up the webpage using potentially bootstrap
- Load graphs into html dynamically using flask

NOTES:
- Currently doing ongoing testing to see whether or not the database is getting signifigantly longer to parse each run (testing indexing)
